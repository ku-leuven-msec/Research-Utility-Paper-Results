## Repository Content

This repository consists of 5 folders: Datasets, AnonymizedDataset, AnonymizedDatasetStats, OptimizedStatistics and Results.

### Datasets

The **Datasets** folder contains the datasets that were used to obtain the results.

### AnonymizedDataset

The **AnonymizedDataset** folder contains all anonymized datasets, as generated by the ARX tool.

### AnonymizedDatasetStats

The **AnonymizedDatasetStats** folder contains csv files with all metrics related to the anonymized datasets. The files contain the folowing information in order (one value on each line): 
node name - highest score - lowest score - total generalization level - number of suppressed records - non uniform entropy - discerniblity - precision

### OptimizedStatistics

The **OptimizedStatistics** folder contains two files for each generated anonymous dataset. 

\<samplingrate\>-rau-detailled.csv contains the RAU (Resource Allocation Utility) values, the complete solution and the total cost for each individual sample. 

\<samplingrate\>-rau.csv contains an overview of the average RAU values.

### Results

The **Results** folder combines the results of our experiments in one general overview.
